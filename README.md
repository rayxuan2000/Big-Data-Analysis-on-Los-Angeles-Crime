# Big-Data-Analysis-on-Los-Angeles-Crime
In this project, I will use spark for big data analysis on LA crime data from 2010 to 2019. It's based on big data platform - Spark (on Databricks). The main purpose for this project is to get familiar with using distributed file system to analyze plenty of data. I implemented two kinds of programming languages (Python and SQL) to query the result of some pre-designed problems. Also did a time series analysis on this dataset using ARIMA model to practice relevant skills.
